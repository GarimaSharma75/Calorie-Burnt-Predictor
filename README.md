# Calorie Burn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts the number of calories burned during exercise using a machine learning model. Users input details such as heart rate, exercise duration, weight, height, age, and body temperature, and the model estimates calorie expenditure.

## Features
- **User Inputs**: Age, height, weight, exercise duration, heart rate, and body temperature.
- **Model**: Uses **XGBRegressor** for accurate calorie burn prediction.
- **Data Scaling**: Standardized with **StandardScaler** for improved performance.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
